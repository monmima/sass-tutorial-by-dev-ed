# sass-tutorial-by-dev-ed

This is the final code of a [simple tutorial by Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI).

1. In VS Code, search and install the Live Sass Compiler extension (eye icon)
2. Create a style .scss file
3. Click on the .scss icon at the bottom of the window (blue bar) to use the live mode

## What you can do with Sass / Scss

1. Create variables
2. Nesting
3. separating code into files and importing into a main .scss file
4. mixins (enables you to reuse code)
5. extensions (= inheritance, basically)
6. calculations (e.g. width: 100vw - 20%)
